** syntax 
*** functional traits						      :drill:
- interfaces for functions
- we introduce data types with [traits]
**** sealed trait
- sealed means that all implentations must be in this file, kinda the same as [dinal]
***  other syntax quirks					      :drill:
- each anonymous function has a implicit [apply] method that exposes the interface or [trait] of the function
- the function apply means that a function object can be called implicitly
- square brackets with capitals signify [generics]/[polymorphic] functions
- remember that anonymous functions should be wrapped in [brackets] and can name arguments only at [top] level
- note that applying 1 function after another requires repeated use of [brackets]

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def uncurry[A,B,C](f: A => B=> C): (A,B)=>C =
(a:A,b:B) => f (a) (b)
#+END_SRC

*** data constructors						      :drill:
- varying forms use the case statement
  - think overloading constructors
- are made by [extend]ing the trait
- each data constructor introduces a pattern
*** collections

**** lists
- lists can be made [polymorphic] with square brackets
- adding a + makes the list [covariant]
- We defined Nil to extend List[Nothing]
  - Nothing mathes all types
  - Therefore because list is covarient
    - Nil has a type [List[A]] for any A
   
*****  Variadic functions 					      :drill:
what does _* mean? 
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
//recursively applies cons
def apply[A](as: A*): List[A] =
  if (as.isEmpty) Nil
  else Cons(as.head, apply(as.tail: _*))
}
#+END_SRC

****** The Answer
- * is just syntatic sugar for a Seq which are lists or array like structures passed around instead of variable arguments
- as is bound to Seq[A] http://mng.bz/f4k9
- _~* allows us to pass a Seq to a varargs method,
  - a bit like pythonic **
***** covariance
- generally if X is a subtype of Y then 
  - List[X] is a subtupe of List[Y]

***** companion objects
- has the same [name] as our data type
- also has [convience] functions
**** constructor quirks 					      :drill:
why is Nil defined with object a and list defined via class
***** TODO The Answer

**** pattern matching
- _ matches any value
#+BEGIN_SRC scala

def sum(ints:List[Int]):Int = ints match {
case Nil => 0
case Cons(x,xs) => x + sum(xs)
}

#+END_SRC


***** syntatical quirks						      :drill:
- need the ints for the match clause 
      -called the [target] or [scrutinee]
- case statements
